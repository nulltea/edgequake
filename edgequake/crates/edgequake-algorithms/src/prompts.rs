pub fn algorithm_inventory_prompt() -> String {
    r#"You are identifying algorithms, protocols, and schemes in an excerpt from a research paper.

## Your Task
Find distinct algorithms, protocols, schemes, or procedures described **within this excerpt only**.
The excerpt may be a section, page, or chunk — not the whole paper.
Only include items that have procedural/step-by-step content VISIBLE in the excerpt — skip vague mentions or things only referenced.
If no algorithms are present in this excerpt, return an empty `algorithms` array.

## What Counts as an Algorithm
- Named algorithms with defined steps (e.g., "Algorithm 1: FedAvg")
- Protocols with message flows or phases
- Schemes with defined construction/execution procedures
- Training/optimization procedures with specific update rules
- Data processing pipelines with defined stages

## What Does NOT Count
- General concepts mentioned without procedural detail
- Related work references to other papers' algorithms
- Evaluation metrics or benchmarks (unless they define a procedure)

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
Each definition must be **self-contained and implementable**. The reader has NO access to the paper.
Every mathematical formula, threshold, hyperparameter, and decision rule must be explicit.

## Your Task
For each algorithm in the inventory below, produce a complete structured definition.
The paper excerpt is provided above — use it to extract precise details.

## Step Format Rules
- Each step is an **imperative action** ("Compute X", "Initialize Y", "For each Z, do W")
- Include implementation-level detail in the `details` field
- Use LaTeX for ALL math: `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display

## LaTeX Conventions (token-efficient)
- Vectors: `$\mathbf{{x}}$` or `$x_i$`
- Sums: `$\sum_{{i=1}}^{{n}}$`
- Fractions: `$\frac{{a}}{{b}}$`
- Greek: `$\alpha, \beta, \theta, \nabla$`
- Sets: `$\mathcal{{D}}, \mathbb{{R}}^d$`
- Norms: `$\|x\|_2$`

## Self-Containment Check
Before finalizing each algorithm, verify:
1. Could someone implement this from ONLY your definition?
2. Are all variables defined before use?
3. Are all hyperparameters/thresholds specified with values or ranges?
4. Are termination conditions explicit?
5. Are edge cases mentioned in preconditions?

If any answer is "no", add the missing information.

## Guidelines
- Extract 1-5 algorithms, ranked by importance
- Keep step count between 3-15 per algorithm
- Pseudocode should be language-agnostic (no specific syntax)
- Keep the total response under 6000 tokens

        r#"You are verifying the quality and implementability of extracted algorithm definitions.

## Your Task
Review each algorithm definition for completeness, correctness, and self-containment.

## Checks to Perform

### 1. Implementability
- Can each algorithm be implemented from the definition alone (no paper access)?
- Are all variables defined before use?
- Are termination conditions explicit?
- Are hyperparameters specified with concrete values or ranges?

### 2. Step Completeness
- Are steps ordered correctly?
- Are there missing intermediate steps?
- Is mathematical notation consistent across steps?

### 3. Mathematical Correctness
- Is LaTeX well-formed?
- Are dimensions/types consistent?

## Verification Status Guidelines
- pass: All algorithms are implementable, no errors
- warn: Minor issues (warnings only) that don't block implementation
- fail: Critical issues — undefined variables, missing steps, or invalid citations

## Guidelines
- Be concise. Keep the total response under 2000 tokens.
